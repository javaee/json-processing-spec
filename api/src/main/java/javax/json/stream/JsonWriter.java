/**
 * A JSON generator. It is also a {@code JsonVisitor} and its visit methods
 * are called to generate JSON. For example:
 *
 * <code>
 * <pre>
 * JsonWriter writer = JsonWriter.create(...);
 * JsonObjectVisitor personWriter = writer.visitObject();
 * personWriter.visitString("firstName", "John");
 * personWriter.visitString("lastName", "Smith");
 * personWriter.visitNumber("age", 25);
 * JsonArrayVisitor phoneWriter = personWriter.visitArray("phoneNumber");
 * JsonObjectVisitor homePhoneWriter = phoneWriter.visitObject();
 * homePhoneWriter.visitString("type", "home");
 * homePhoneWriter.visitString("number", "212 555-1234");
 * homePhoneWriter.visitEnd();
 * JsonObjectVisitor faxPhoneWriter = phoneWriter.visitObject();
 * faxPhoneWriter.visitString("type", "fax");
 * faxPhoneWriter.visitString("number", "646 555-4567");
 * faxPhoneWriter.visitEnd();
 * phoneWriter.visitEnd();
 * personWriter.visitEnd();
 * writer.close();
 *
 * would produce a JSON equivalent to the following:
 * {
 *   "firstName": "John", "lastName": "Smith", "age": 25,
 *   "phoneNumber": [
 *       {"type": "home", "number": "212 555-1234"},
 *       {"type": "fax", "number": "646 555-4567"}
 *    ]

 *
 * TODO should we add convenience methods with method chaining ?
